## Team Members

## Project Name
**Memory Allocator / Heap**

## Short Description
This project implements a **memory allocator** in C that mimics the functionality of standard library functions `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and `calloc`. 

Includes:
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`) with block splitting.
- Memory deallocation (`free`) with coalescing.
- Memory resizing (`realloc`) and zero-initialized allocation (`calloc`).
